## Change Log
[v0.0.6]

*Features & Quality of Life*
- Full visual mode implementation (v for character, V for line selection)
- Complete copy/paste system with yank buffer (y to copy, p/P to paste)
- Additional vim motions: w/b (word movement), 0/$ (line start/end)
- Character replacement with r, line joining with J
- Enhanced help system (:help in editor, -h/--help from command line)
- New file creation - editing non-existent files creates them on save
- Improved terminal cleanup on exit

*Bug Fixes*
- Fixed undo/redo segfault when undoing paste operations
- Resolved terminal color persistence after exit
- Corrected visual selection boundary handling
- Fixed edge cases with empty line selections


[v0.0.5]
*Features & Quality of Life*
- While I'm not looking to create another neovim, there are many features of vim I do enjoy
- More vi-like functionality with undo (u in normal)/redo (ctrl + r in normal) blocks
- Undo blocks function with time, action, and mode based boundries
- Configuarable undo levels, located in .hakorc (default=100)
- Options for number and relative number mode, replacing (ex. "~" with "1") available in .hakorc
- Number mode currently supports up 4 characters (ex. 9999 lines) 

*Bug Fixes*
- Fixed terminal crashing from invalid line jumps
- Corrected cursor positioning and edge cases partaining to empty file navigation
- Removed duplicate code and minor debug output left in from previous testing

[v0.0.2-0.0.4]
- Added familiar vi-inspired modes & commands (normal & insert, /, :, :w, :wq, :q); susceptible to change
- Line jump fuction via :NUMBER (ex. :120 goes to line 120)
- Ctrl + f pages fwd ctrl + b pages bwd
- Implemented tt (go to line 1) and bb (go to last line) normal mode shortcuts
- Improved the fuzzy find triggered by /, use arrow keys or scroll to move between finds, enter/esc to exit
- Added language support for c++, c#, java, Rust, SQL, HTML/CSS, and Javascript (in addition to Python & C)
- Established default font color theme, found in .hakorc
- Alternate-screen & clean exit, wiping the terminal

## Usage
#### Compile `hako.c`(ex. gcc)
```bash
gcc hako.c -o hako
```
#### Then launch it with:
```bash
./hako or ./hako [yourfile]
```

Your terminal becomes a box that holds your code, structured and serene.
