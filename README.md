# Hako (箱) Editor

_Hako_ (箱) — the Japanese word for “box”—symbolizes a simple container that holds only what is essential. In this spirit, Hako Editor is built as a lean, focused text editing tool designed for engineers who appreciate clarity, precision, and the elegance of minimalism.

## Overview

Hako is not about frills or flashy interfaces. It is a meditation on simplicity—a box that contains your code without distraction. Inspired by the original Kilo editor (which is in the public domain), Hako is a personal exploration into the art of software minimalism.

- **Minimalist Syntax Highlighting:** Start with robust C support, with plans to expand to Python and other languages.
- **Configurable Aesthetics:** Tailor the environment with a simple configuration file, adjusting everything from keybindings to the display of auxiliary marks.
- **Zen-Like Focus:** Every feature is designed to keep your workspace uncluttered, so you can focus on the essence of your work.

## Philosophy

Just as a humble box holds its contents without pretension, Hako Editor embraces the philosophy of “less is more.” The kanji 「箱」 is not merely a logo—it is a reminder that the simplest solutions often yield the most profound clarity. Here, the editor is your box: a clean, unadorned space where your code is free to breathe.

## Usage

Compile the editor with your preferred POSIX-compliant compiler. For example, on Linux or macOS:

```bash
gcc -o hako main.c

Then launch it with:

./hako [filename]

Your screen becomes a canvas—a box that holds your code, structured and serene.

Future Directions

Broader Syntax Support: Expanding to languages like Python, with each language receiving its own gentle highlighting.
Enhanced Configurability: A refined configuration system that lets you modify the editor’s aesthetic and behavior to suit your meditative workflow.
More Intuitive Key Bindings: Additional hotkeys to streamline your coding process, keeping your interactions as straightforward as the design itself.
